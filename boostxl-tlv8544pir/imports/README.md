# JLCPCB / EasyEDA imports

All populated electronic parts other than resistors and capacitors are instantiated directly from components generated with `tsci import --jlcpcb --use-exact-footprint`. The exact supplier footprint geometry is retained, while 3D models are referenced from the tscircuit model CDN rather than stored in this repository.

The importer sanitized punctuation in several generated TypeScript identifiers and MPN strings. Component identifiers remain valid TypeScript, while the `manufacturerPartNumber` metadata was restored to the supplier's real MPN. The TLV333 import's generated pin aliases were also corrected against the data sheet: pin 2 is `V_NEG` and pin 4 is `IN_NEG`.

H1 is the Murata `IML-0688` Fresnel lens. It is mechanical rather than an electrical source component; its 10.8-mm envelope is shown on board silkscreen.
